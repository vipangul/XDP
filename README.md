# XRT Debug/Profile

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The XRT Debug/Profile libraries are designed to be built and used in
conjunction with XRT and not as a standalone tool.  This set of loadable
modules implement debug/profiling functionality on host code, PL constructs,
and AIE components.

User controls are through the xrt.ini file.  Support exists for both PCIe
based platforms and embedded platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XRT, and subsequently XDP, is run on a variety of platforms with varying
hardware and capabilities.  Specifically, XDP supports the following:

1. Edge Hardware (boards like the vck190 and vek280).
* Host code on edge using load_xclbin.
* Host code on edge using hw_context.
* Supported features include host trace, PL profiling and trace, AIE profiling and trace, AIE status, PL deadlock detection.

2. Edge Hardware Emulation (QEMU + XSim for vck190 and vek280)
* Host code on edge emulation using load_xclbin.
* Host code on edge emulation using hw_context.
* Supported features include host trace, PL profiling and trace, AIE profiling and trace

3. Alveo Hardware (boards like the u250 and u55c)
* Host code on Alveo using load_xclbin.
* Supported features include host trace, PL profiling and trace

4. Alveo Hardware Emulation
* Host code on Alveo using load_xclbin.
* Supported features include host trace, PL profiling and trace

5. Client hardware - Windows
* Host code written for VAIML designs using hw_contexts.  Communication with
    the hardware must pass along hardware context IDs and use tranasactions
    (or elf) to configure the AIE
* Supported features include host trace, user events, AIE profiling and trace,
    and ML timeline.

6. Client hardware - Linux
* Host code written for VAIML designs using hw_contexts.  Communication with
    the hardware must pass along hardware context IDs and use tranasactions
    (or elf) to configure the AIE
* Supported features include host trace, user events, AIE profiling and trace,
    and ML timeline.

7. VE2 (Vitis)
* Host code written for Vitis designs using load_xclbin
* Host code written for Vitis designs using hw_context.
* Supported features include host trace, user events, AIE profiling and trace.
    All control of the AIE hardware is done through direct calls to aie driver
    and zocl.

8. VE2 (VAIML)
* Host code written for VAIML designs using hw_context.
* Supported features include host trace, user events, AIE profiling and trace.
    All control of the AIE hardware is done through direct calls to aie driver
    and zocl.
